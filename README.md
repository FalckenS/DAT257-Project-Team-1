# Unamed Android mobile app for finding recycling stations (broken, invalid API)
An Android mobile application that allows users to find the nearest recycling stations based on their current location or any specified location. The app provides two main options: users can either search for a location or allow the app to automatically detect their location. The nearest recycling stations will then be displayed either as a list of cards or on an interactive map. The cards show the station's name, address, and distance from the user's location. The map displays the stations as markers.
